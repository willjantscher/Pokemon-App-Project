# Pokemon-App-Project

 Pokemon React App
Technology to use: - React
- API: ​https://pokeapi.co/
Fire up your own Github repository for this project. Please use something like VSCode LiveShare to pair program effectively! You’ll be in groups of 3-4, so please be sure you’re switching “roles” as you see fit. At the end, you’ll submit your repo link directly to Katie so she can review your code.
Note about APIs: ​ALWAYS read the documentation first. Figure out what the data is shaped like, how things are working, what data is available, etc. This initial research will help you design your application and understand the data you are dealing with.
Final note: ​We do not have specifics in mind for how this app should look, this is for you to use some of the things you’ve learned in class and stretch your creative muscles! Have fun with it!
User stories​ ​are used to define a clear “point of done” within the feature context when building applications. They provide a base for the structure of your code. Usually - they provide the structure of your tests - in this case, we don’t insist that you approach this project from a TDD perspective (though, if you’re ambitious, feel free to do so). They are written, commonly, in a “As a _____, I want _____, so that _____.” format.
Primarily: they force you to think from the perspective of the user.
- As a user, I want to be able to search for a specific Pokemon so that I can see all of the important/relevant information about them.
- As a user (who is new to Pokemon and doesn’t know any names to search!), I want to click on a “View All” (or similar) button and look at page with pictures of all the pokemon so that I can click on the picture and learn more about them!
- As a user I want to click on a “View similar types” button for a specific pokemon and I will see a list of other pokemon with the same type.
- As a user, I want each Pokemon to have a “collect” feature so that I can add it to my collection if I like it.
- As a user, I want to have a “view collection” feature so that I can view my whole collection at any time
- As a user, I want there to be a “battle” feature where I can see who would win between two Pokemon (here,
you can select two Pokemon and have them battle, and based on some criteria, you determine the winner)
- As a user, I want there to be a “stats” feature where I can see the stats on a specific Pokemon (open to
interpretation how you want to handle this/what you want to feature!)
